## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher


📚 Components
## Models
The Model Component is a crucial part of the LangChain framework, designed to facilitate interactions with various language models and embedding models. This directory contains implementations and examples of working with different LLM providers.

## Prompts
Contains prompt templates and engineering examples for effective interaction with language models.

## Structured Output
Contains Output examples (typed dict, pydantic, json) and engineering examples for effective interaction with language models.

## Chains
Contains Chains examples (Simple, Sequential, Parallel, Conditional) and engineering examples for effective interaction with language models.
