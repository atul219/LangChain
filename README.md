# LangChain

A comprehensive repository for exploring and implementing Generative AI applications using LangChain framework.

## 📋 Overview

This repository demonstrates the implementation of LangChain components, focusing on language models and their practical applications in Generative AI. The Model Component in LangChain facilitates interactions with various language models and embedding models.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher


📚 Components
## Models
The Model Component is a crucial part of the LangChain framework, designed to facilitate interactions with various language models and embedding models. This directory contains implementations and examples of working with different LLM providers.

## Prompts
Contains prompt templates and engineering examples for effective interaction with language models.

## Retrievers
Contains retrievers examples (document and searching based) for effective interaction with language models.

## Structured Output
Contains Output examples (typed dict, pydantic, json) and engineering examples for effective interaction with language models.

## Chains
Contains Chains examples (Simple, Sequential, Parallel, Conditional) and engineering examples for effective interaction with language models.

## Document Loader
Contains Document Loader examples (text, pdf, csv, web) and engineering examples for effective interaction with language models.

## Text Splitter
Contains Text Splitter examples (Length, Text-Structure, Document-Structure, Semantic Meaning) and engineering examples for effective interaction with language models.

## Vector Store
Contains Vector Store examples of Chroma db and engineering examples for effective interaction with language models.
